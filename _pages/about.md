Hi! I am an incoming Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), where I will be joining the [WiCI lab](https://wici.iastate.edu/), advised by [Professor Hongwei Zhang](https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~hongwei/). My research will be at the intersection of `wireless systems`, `edge intelligence`, and `AI-driven connectivity`, with a goal of making next-generation networks more intelligent, and accessible for rural communities. 

Before starting my Ph.D. journey, I worked as a `Core Cloud Infrastructure Engineer` at [Grameenphone](https://www.grameenphone.com), the leading telecom operator in Bangladesh, where I contributed to cutting-edge projects in cloud infrastructure, AIOps, and network monitoring. 

I completed my Bachelor’s in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://buet.ac.bd/) (BUET), the country’s most prestigious engineering university, majoring in `communication and signal processin`.


Beyond work, I love organizing fun team events, travelling,  donating blood (12 times and counting!), and building tech that actually helps people. I am excited to begin this new chapter and contribute to smarter, more connected systems that serve communities better.
